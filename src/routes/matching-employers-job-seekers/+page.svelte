      <p class="s">
        In 2019, TRR mostly helped employers during redundancies and recruiting
        candidates. But TRR realized they could extend their offering to
        employers by improving their current digital offerings. Therefore, my
        team was formed with the goal to identify these opportunities and
        execute on them.

        <p>Summary</p>
        <p>
          Working as the sole UX Designer in a team of developers and a product
          manager we created a search tool for recruiters to find qualified and
          competent staff. I had a leading role and facilitated the design
          process with the team. I did extensive user research, prototypes, UI
          and user tests.

      <h2 class="m" id="Talk-to-employers">Part I: Talk to employers üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, I conducted research by interviewing over 20 representatives
        from the employer side and developed 5 <a
          href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona/">personas</a
        > based on their needs, goals, attitudes, and behavior patterns. From this
        research, it became clear that there was significant potential for improvement
        to increase the value delivered to employers and their employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prioritize our efforts, our product manager identified HR managers at
        medium-to-large companies as the primary target represented by one of
        the personas. I then facilitated workshops to further explore the needs
        and desires of this persona, using <a
          href="https://www.inuse.se/read/many-faces-impact-mapping/"
          >Impact Mapping</a
        >
        sessions to identify key objectives and actions. Some of the challenges expressed
        in the persona was:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reskilling and upskilling employees</li>
        <li>Managing organizational changes</li>
        <li>Recruitment of the right candidates</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Product Manager determined that our primary persona's need for
        hiring qualified employees required a solution. To address this
        challenge, I facilitated a remote
        <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design Sprint</a>
        and invited the developers, the Product Manager, and other relevant stakeholders.
        Since the participants were located remotely, we used
        <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Miro</a> as a collaboration tool to ensure
        that everyone had an equal opportunity to contribute.

      <h2 class="m">The winner</h2>

      <p>
        After voting, the idea that received the most support was a recruitment
        tool for employers. Our goal was to match the competencies required by
        employers with qualified job-seekers from TRR's extensive pool of
        candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        To test the prototype, I evaluated the main concept's viability by
        conducting tests with 5 HR managers. Our riskiest assumption was that HR
        managers would be interested in recruiting job-seekers from TRR. The
        focus of the test was to determine if HR managers would use the
        recruitment tool in their daily work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, the HR managers were enthusiastic about our proposed
        concept. They found it particularly useful for finding competencies that
        are difficult to find and saw a significant benefit in contacting
        candidates through TRR before they entered the official labor market.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result of the Design Sprint, we developed a tested prototype and
        several new hypotheses that we needed to evaluate further.
      </p>

      <div class="divider">
        <img src="{srcDivider}" alt="Divider svg" />
      </div>

      <h2 class="m" id="Refinements">Part III: Refinements ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the feedback received, I revised the prototypes and included
        more refined ideas as we progressed. The prototype was further tested
        with employers, which revealed that recruitment agencies were also
        interested in gaining access to TRR's candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        To develop the first iteration, we focused on including only the most
        essential features. At the same time, we continued to refine the
        functionality to determine which other features were most important and
        how the service could be seamlessly integrated into the user's daily
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        To evaluate our hypotheses, we conducted iterative user tests with
        prototypes and user interviews. Based on our research, we identified
        three key goals that we needed to achieve:
      </p>

      <ul class="margin">
        <li>
          Enable employers to find candidates with industry-specific
          competencies, such as programming languages or industry-specific
          software.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow recruiters to quickly evaluate whether a candidate is a good fit
          for both the role and the company. Many recruiters expressed a desire
          to review the career goals of candidates before considering reaching
          out to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide search results at high speed to avoid making users wait when
          adding or removing search filters.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="m">Present the right candidates</h2>
      <p>
        A big challenge was to make sure the results of the search were
        perceived as relevant to recruiters. We needed to figure out if we
        should present candidates who fulfills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the criterias.</li>
        <li>At least one criteria from each category.</li>
        <li>Any of the criterias.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We explored different solutions to this challenge and talked to our
        target users. From my research we got the insight about recruiters often
        have a perfect profile with all the competencies required in the job
        description. In reality, it's difficult to find candidates who checks
        all the boxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore we decided to separate the search results list in two, one
        with candidates who fulfilled all of the criterias and a second where we
        included the candidates who were missing some criterias. In the second
        one, the missing criterias were also highlighted to allow the user to
        quickly evaluate the profiles.
      </p>

      <h2 class="m" id="Result">Result</h2>
      <p>
        Although we had a first basic version of the service almost ready to be
        released, we hit some trouble. Instead of releasing it to employers
        right away, the management team postponed the launch. The reason was
        because the functionality for employers to sign in to TRR wasn't yet
        ready. A huge learning for me has been the importance of identifying all
        dependencies early on. Instead of releasing it right away to our target
        group, the management team decided to make it available as an internal
        tool. This was a set back for us, but I know that we did a lot of good
        work, and are proud of what we achieved:
      </p>
      <ul class="margin">
        <li>
          A simle and smooth UI for searching for candidates. The user research
          showed that employers couldn‚Äôt wait to start using our service.
        </li>
        <li>
          A base of extensive user research to build upon. A huge part of the
          work I did was establishing a knowledge base for the organization to
          continue improving and identifying opportunities from.
        </li>
        <li>
          We were the first team at TRR to use the Design Sprint as a method to
          involve the stakeholders in the organization and solve problems
          together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrating the power of design where we showed the organization how
          to develop meaningful and valuable services using a user-centered
          approach.
